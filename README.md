**Weather Forecasting Chatbot**

This repo contains an end to end chatbot that takes (weather query) as a voice input and returns the(weather status) answer as a voice output. 

As of now the chatbot is not equipped with named entity recognition (or) any sort of entity recognition per say.

They will be added to the bot taking later on.
